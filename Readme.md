# Frontend Development Guide

Welcome to the frontend development team! This guide will help you get started with the project and establish a smooth workflow for collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git https://github.com/lorenzoworx/wdm-group-project.git
cd wdm-group-project
```


### Switch to Frontend Branch

Once you've cloned the repository, switch to the frontend branch:

```
git checkout frontend
```

### Create Your Personal Branch

Each team member should create their own branch from the frontend branch. Use the naming convention `yourname_frontend`:

```bash
git checkout -b yourname_frontend
```

Replace `yourname` with your actual name. For example:
- `dhanya_frontend`
- `sanjukktha_frontend`
- `gowtham_frontend`

## Daily Workflow

### Before Starting Work

Always pull the latest changes from the frontend branch before you start working:

```bash
git checkout frontend
git pull origin frontend
git checkout yourname_frontend
git merge frontend
```

This ensures you're working with the most up-to-date code and helps prevent merge conflicts later.

### While Working

Make your changes and commit them regularly with clear, descriptive messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes made"
```

### Pushing Your Work

When you're ready to share your work, push your branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin yourname_frontend
```

If this is your first push on this branch, you might need to set the upstream:

```bash
git push -u origin yourname_frontend
```

### Merging to Frontend Branch

Once your work is complete and tested, create a pull request to merge your changes into the frontend branch. This allows the team to review your code before it becomes part of the main frontend codebase.

## Best Practices

- **Commit often**: Make small, logical commits with clear messages
- **Pull regularly**: Update your branch with the latest frontend changes at least once a day
- **Communicate**: Let the team know when you're working on a specific feature
- **Test before pushing**: Always test your changes locally before pushing
- **Review pull requests**: Help review your teammates' code to maintain quality
